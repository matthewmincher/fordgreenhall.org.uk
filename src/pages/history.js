				<p className={Styles.copy}>Ford Green Hall was built in 1624 for Hugh Ford. It is a fine example of a timber-framed farm house. The Ford family lived at the Hall for nearly 200 years. Mr Ford was a yeoman dairy farmer and owned 36 acres of land. In the 19th century after the Ford family left the status of the house declined and it was divided into 3 and later 4 cottages.</p>
				<p className={Styles.copy}>An award-winning museum, the Hall offers visitors a fascinating insight into the life of the 17th century. The rooms are furnished with an outstanding collection of textiles, ceramics and furniture.</p>
				<p className={Styles.copy}>Now transferred to Ford Green Hall Ltd, a charitable organisation led by volunteers and members of the local community, the company’s profits will be used to run and improve the museum.</p>
				<p className={Styles.copy}>Ford Green Hall is continuing to work closely with Stoke-on-Trent City Council and its museums.</p>
