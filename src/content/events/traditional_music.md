Three local musicians from RSQ, will be playing
for us at the Hall. 

&nbsp;

Richard Snell on fiddle, Gill Greig on flute,
and Peter Hopkins on English concertina.

&nbsp;

RSQ is a group of
musicians based in North Staffordshire who have come
together to play Richard's own music, and they have created a
fresh and original sound which suits that music very well.

&nbsp;

The music itself, though very much in his style, is rooted in the
great folk-traditions of the British Isles and Europe, and reflects
the joyfulness and the variety of those traditions. We like the
sound they make and hope you will, too!

Normal admission applies.
